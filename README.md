# CS-360-Final-Project
The app I developed was designed to address the need for easy management of user accounts and data within a mobile application. The main goals were to provide a user-friendly login system and an organized, flexible database structure that allowed users to create and manage their data through CRUD operations. This app was built to support a variety of user needs, including the ability to log in, create new accounts, update data, and receive notifications for specific events. The app ensures that users can easily interact with the data they store and access it whenever needed.

To support these user needs, I created a simple, intuitive user interface with essential screens like a login page, a registration page, a dashboard displaying data in a grid, and a settings page for managing app features like SMS permissions. The UI design was centered around ease of use and clarity. I used clear labeling, minimalistic design elements, and an intuitive flow between screens to ensure that users could easily navigate through the app. These decisions helped create a smooth user experience, as the design focused on what was most important to the users and allowed them to quickly understand how to interact with the app’s features.

When approaching the process of coding, I used a structured and modular approach, dividing the app into manageable components like the login system, database integration, and permission handling. I focused on creating reusable functions and keeping the code organized to simplify debugging and future updates. This method allowed me to work efficiently and ensured the app was scalable. The strategies I used in this project, such as modularization and clear function design, could be applied to future app development projects to improve maintainability and ease of collaboration.

I tested the app extensively to ensure its functionality. I used the Android Emulator to test different scenarios, including user login, account creation, CRUD operations, and SMS permission handling. This process was crucial because it helped me catch bugs early and confirm that all features worked as expected under different conditions. Testing also revealed areas where the app could be improved, like optimizing performance during large data operations, and ensured that the app met the user’s expectations for reliability and usability.

Throughout the app design and development process, I had to innovate when implementing the database shell to allow users to interact with the data without fully populating it at the start. This was a challenge because it required careful consideration of how the app’s data would be handled as users began interacting with it. I had to balance the need for a functional database structure with the goal of providing a user-friendly interface that would grow over time.

I was particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge of database integration and user authentication. By designing a secure and reliable login system and ensuring that the app’s database could store and manage user data effectively, I was able to create an app that addressed core user needs and offered a functional, scalable solution. This part of the app reflected my ability to integrate backend and frontend features while maintaining a focus on user experience.
